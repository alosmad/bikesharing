NY Citibike analysis for Des moines project

**Overview of the analysis:**
The analysis has the purpose of having data to support the Des Moines business proposal for bike sharing implementation.

### Results: For supporting the analysis for Des Moines we have created the following visualizations in order to get to conclusions.

The majority of the trips lasts 10 minutes so we are talking about short trip rides although there are some trips that can last up to 50 minutes

Most of the users are males but in average women tend to use the bikes for longer times.

Thursday is the busiest day for trips specifically between 5 to 7 pm. In most of the days it is evident that th usage calls out for riding from work to home between 5 and 7pm, or from home to work between 8 to 9 am. On Saturday and Sunday bike usage is very similar along the day between 10 am and 8pm but it is more used in Sundays.

![4_TripsbyGender](https://github.com/alosmad/bikesharing/blob/5ceb3a677292ca1b41255936f5b0fa2cccd3fdb7/4_TripsbyGender.png)

Although males use more the bikes there is no significant change in usage by weekday. Probably there is more usage on saturdays by females than by males.

![5_TripsbyGenderbyWeekday](https://github.com/alosmad/bikesharing/blob/5ceb3a677292ca1b41255936f5b0fa2cccd3fdb7/5_TripsbyGenderbyWeekday.png)

Most of the users are suscribers, and for no suscribers we have most of the undefined gender which is natural since they tend to avoid sharing information.

***Summary:*** 

For Des Moines implementation we need to focus on users that live nearby their work since it is evident that most of the usage is for work transportation, we don't have certainty if they are people that right now use their private car for going to work or if they take public transportation and they will substitute it for a bike.
Below are two visualization that show that most of the top starting and ending locations are in high profile offices.
It is important to consider that Des Moines is not a tourism city so the usage on Saturday and Sunday could decrease compared with NYC.
